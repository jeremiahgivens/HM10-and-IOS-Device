# HM10-and-IOS-Device
The purpose of this repository is to serve as an example for writing a SwiftUI IOS app for connecting to an HM-10 over Bluetooth Low Energy. The example provided also sends the IOS devices location over BLE to the HM-10, when the button is pressed. An example Arduino program is provided that allows the user to receive messages from the IOS device on the HM-10.
